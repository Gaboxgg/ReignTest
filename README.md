ReignTest App Structure:

Folders tree:

-Adapters
-Interfaces
-Fragments
-Data
-Callbacks

In the main root of the project we can found the MainActivity.

SDK info:
        minSdkVersion 22
        targetSdkVersion 29

At repo you can find the key for sign apk (the key folder called key), I will send you the password of the key by email and u can find an apk
to test the App in the folder "apk".

When u get the apk, u can run it in any Android Device (up to minSdkVersion) or you can use an emulator, I used to do it with NOX (https://es.bignox.com/). Is easy to install,configure and use. 

Let me know if u need help with anything, reply to my emial if u need it.
